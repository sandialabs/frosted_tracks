"""Fixtures for frosted_tracks tests

These should be fixtures that are shared between multiple tests that
cannot reasonably be placed into the same module.

Best practice: put functions that generate whatever-it-is in
files in this directory, refer to those functions in
generate_ground_truth() alongside the test cases, then
put wrappers in pytest_wrappers.py so that you can use them
as fixtures.
